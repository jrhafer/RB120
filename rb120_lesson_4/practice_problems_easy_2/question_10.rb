# What are the benefits of using Object Oriented Programming in Ruby? Think of
# as many as you can.

# 1. Creating objects allow programmers to think more abstractly about the code th
#    they are using.
# 2. Objects represented by nouns are easier to conceptualize.
# 3. It allows us to only expose functionality to the parts of code that need
#    it, meaning namespace issues are much harder to come across.
# 4. It allow us to easily give functionality to different parts of an
#    application without duplication.
# 5. We can build applications faster as we can reuse pre-written code.
# 6. As the software becomes more complex this complexity can be more
#    easily managed
